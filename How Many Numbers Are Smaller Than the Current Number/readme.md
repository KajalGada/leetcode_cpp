+ Sort the numbers.
+ The have a counter to count numbers so far.
+ Eg:
  + 8 1 2 2 3 becomes 1 2 2 3 8.
  + We have 0 numbers so far so count for 1 is 0.
  + Then we have 1 numbers so count for 2 is 1.
  + Then we have 2 numbers so count for 3 is 2.
  + Then we have 3 numbers so count for 8 is 3.

+ Next we add counts for each number in the original list.
